# react-to-the-music
Music player application for educational purposes¿

I wrote this application in pursuit of learning web frameworks as well as overall programming. Excuse the barebones-ness :)

Songs consist of ones that I dearly enjoy. What are your go-to tracks?

# Disclaimer
Don't mash the play/pause button as I'm hosting these through Google Drive 😂
But please enjoy 👍

Feel free to contribute by adding more songs or suggesting code practices. Learning React was one of the best things I've been putting off doing
